# Marsh Tree and Landscaping

This site was created for a friends family member who, at the time, owned a landscaping and tree removal business.

As you can probably see, this was one of the first websites I ever created. Way before I even knew about reusabled components and environment variables.

I originally planned on refactoring this project in React but realized that would be a tad overkill for a static website. Instead, I implemented Node, Webpack, and Pug.
